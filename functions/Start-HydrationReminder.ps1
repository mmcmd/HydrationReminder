.SYNOPSIS
    Script that sends you a Windows Notification to remind you to hydrate
.DESCRIPTION
    A fairly simple module to remind you (by default every hour) to drink some water in order to stay hydrated. Inspired by a Twitch Hydration bot
.EXAMPLE
    The following example would send a reminder every 45 mins for 24 hours and assume you're drinking 2500mL of water every 16 hours
    Start-HydrationReminder -ReminderInterval 45 -DailyWaterIntake 2500 -Duration 24
.EXAMPLE
    The following example will use the default values of the cmdlet, which is to remind you every hour for 16 hours to drink
    up to a total of 2000mL at the 16th hour
    Start-HydrationReminder
.PARAMETER ReminderInterval
    Interval in minutes where a reminder will be sent
.PARAMETER DailyWaterIntake
    How much water per 16 hours needs to be consumed
.PARAMETER Duration
    Amount of hours notifications to hydrate will be sent for
.OUTPUTS
    PSCustomObject
        Outputs a PSCustomObject with the following properties:
            Successful = boolean
            ReminderInterval =  Interval in minutes where a reminder will be sent
            DailyWaterIntake = How much water per 16 hours needs to be consumed
            StartedAt = Time at which hydration reminder started (datetime)
            EndsAt = Time at which hydration reminder will end (datetime)
            Status = Status of the background job created
            Location = Location attribute of the job created
            JobID = ID of the job created
            JobName = Name of the job created (by default called 'HydrationReminder')
            JobInstanceID = Instance ID of the job created
